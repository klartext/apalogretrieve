# Apalogretrieve - A tool to extract information from Apache logfiles with SQL-like syntax

A while ago I recovered/excavated <b>apalogretrieve</b>,
a somewhat old tool from 2008.

It was initially located here (where you also find documentation for this tool):
<a href="https://www.first.in-berlin.de/software/tools/apalogretrieve/">apalogrterieve</a>.

The latest sources that were available there (apalogretrieve 0.9.6_4 (2008-01-31))
did not compile with current versions of
<a href="https://www.ocaml.org">OCaml</a>, so I decided to make them compile again.

I also added the date comparison functionality, which was not available in that old version.

For mor information, please see at the above mention page.
